ECS does not have computing power builtin 
So it takes power from mainly two
    1. EC2 (Gives Full control to control infrastructure)
    2. Fargate (AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with 
                Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage 
                servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances)
                No need maintain or provision EC2 servers

Task Definition - Blue print containing all info about how to run containers
Task - Running container based on tasks definition file

ECS Service - Ensures that these no of tasks are running at all times.
